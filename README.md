# lottoAnalysis
A quick project that provides some insight to randomly generated lottery data.

The project generates a specified number of lottery draws (based on current UK rules), gives the option to display the draws and analyse the ranges of numbers that have been drawn.

As the project only uses psuedo random numbers, the spread of the numbers always falls where you might expect it to mathematically.

This project is a good starting point for somebody who wants to analyse real lottery data and / or generate other analysis tools.

I might not update this code again as it was just a project that came to mind this morning and I'm working on something bigger at this time (see my sportsBook repository). However, I have some ideas as to how it could grow, so, never say never!
